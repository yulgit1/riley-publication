The show would explore her feelings about the United States. She holds an enormous fondness for this country, particularly New York, and this — her first major survey in the US — would acknowledge her gratitude for the transformative impact it has had on her career following her first visit in 1965.\nThat initial trip brought her to New York after being invited to show two paintings in the groundbreaking exhibition featuring “recent works with primarily visual emphasis”: The Responsive Eye, at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). In the lead-up to the show, she developed a close working relationship with William Seitz, the exhibition’s curator, which resulted in the acquisition of Current (1964), one of the two paintings included — funded by architect, collector, and founder of MoMA’s architecture department, Philip Johnson. Current was also incorporated into the design of the exhibition catalogue and used for much of the press, which, in turn, lauded the show and Riley’s work in it. The exhibition proved to be a catalyst for the artist, both professionally and personally, and the prominence of the painting and of Riley set the tone for how she would come to view this experience nearly sixty years later.\n       Expand Bridget Riley, Current, 1964.The Museum of Modern Art, Philip Johnson Fund, 1964  Supportive of Riley, Johnson later gave the museum another one of her paintings, Fission (1962). This further bolstered the perception that MoMA considered her on par with US and European peers and within an international roster of modernists decades removed from her in time. At the events surrounding the show and in the weeks that followed, when she remained in the city, Riley met some of those peers, who brought her into their studios and social circles. To Jasper Johns, Mark Rothko, Ad Reinhardt, and many others, she was a serious, unwavering abstractionist, despite her youth, gender, and nationality. The success of the show in all of its five touring venues across the United States (New York to Baltimore, St. Louis, Seattle, and, finally, Pasadena), and the reception of her work by artists, collectors, and the public outside of New York, gave her a sense that the whole country was indeed supportive of her. As Riley relayed to me, she found something so open and warm about Americans and their response to her work, which gave her a true sense of confidence in pushing her practice forward. That feeling continues to this day.\nFrom an art-historical perspective, the use of Current on the front and back covers of MoMA’s publication has always seemed, to me, to be a metaphor for how Riley defined not only that show but also that moment in contemporary art internationally. For someone who has long used mid-twentieth-century Britain as a way to understand the art of the rest of the world, this representation of Riley’s painting catalyzed my sense of her as a codex for the ways in which art (even if seemingly apolitical or deeply formalist) conceptualizes all that is happening at a specific moment. Seitz’s opening acknowledgments in the catalogue also recognize the work of the designer, Joseph Bourke Del Valle, which seems all the more auspicious for this same reason: clearly, Bourke Del Valle equally understood the import of Riley in that show at that time — not so much as mascot, but as beacon.\nConsequently, Riley has chosen Perceptual Abstraction as the show’s title. Seitz used the phrase to describe how the advancement of art from nineteenth-century Impressionism to the 1960s was predicated upon the artist’s perception carefully evolving, not simply “[changing] aimlessly”1 — to such a degree that recent abstract art was being purposefully, if not relentlessly, driven by refinements to “color, tone, line, and shape.”2 Riley’s own early studies of nineteenth-century representational painters, like Georges Seurat, as part of her process to achieve full geometric abstraction resonated with Seitz’s concept. And although his show took a reduced version of this idea as its title — The Responsive Eye — Riley has held onto Seitz’s more nuanced original intent.\nCentral to our exhibition are two of her Late Morning paintings: Late Morning 1 (1967) and Late Morning (1967–68). Completed just as she transitioned from an achromatic palette of black and white into full color, these pieces also mark the elongation of the square support to the horizontal and the visual variables created by the lines or stripes in each. Riley finished these works after returning to London from New York and settling into her newfound success (which had, by then, become global), and they demonstrate what she was clearly experiencing after 1965: mastery of skill, confidence in her practice, surety of decisions, and, perhaps most important, the drive to innovate. It is a rarity for the YCBA to give over multiple floors to a single artist, let alone a living one, and yet, I can think of no better way to explore these facets of her practice from the 1960s to the present.\n       Expand Bridget Riley, Late Morning, 1967–68.Tate: Purchased 1968  Listening to Riley’s stories of her early visits to the United States and her deep, intellectual concerns with and about painting has given me optimism over the last three years about both the world and the field of art history — the latter being one of the things I hold most dear. During some of the strangest days of 2020 and 2021, I have had Riley’s reasoned, thoughtful approach to the past as well as the present to rely on, even as the America that she describes is being challenged every day. I am grateful to her for making 1960s New York (the backdrop for this show) and present-day London (where she was born and still creates, and in which I have spent so much of my life) seem near, despite the obvious, untenable distances of both at this moment.\nRiley’s lifelong confidence in her own vision, reinforced through her early experiences in the United States, is as inspiring as her indomitable spirit during the pandemic, which coincided with the evolution of this exhibition. As much as she is thankful for the support of US audiences in the 1960s, I am grateful for her commitment to seeing this project through, despite considerable complications caused by the global health crisis. From the beginning, she has shaped every aspect of this show (even responding to Louis Kahn’s design of the space), and the dedicated YCBA team facilitated the process by listening intently to how she wished her work to be presented. As a result, what you see is very much her show — her vision.\n— Courtney J. Martin, Paul Mellon Director, Yale Center for British Art notes    William C.

By including Riley and other European artists, the museum sought to legitimize the exhibition’s claims of internationalism and New York’s status as the center of the contemporary art world (even though the checklist was dominated by US artists).1 The title of Riley’s work, with its dual allusion to energetic movement and the present moment, situated the viewing experience in the here and now, time and space. Similarly, the pulsating waves coursing across the picture gave the impression that the eye was being “bombarded with pure energy,” as the curator, William Seitz, described it.2 No prior art knowledge was required to experience the work’s full effect — in fact, the sensorial response it stimulated was so visceral that it was likened to the altered state of consciousness induced by taking hallucinogenic drugs.3\n       Expand Figure 1The Responsive Eye exhibition catalogue, The Museum of Modern Art, 1965  Skeptics about The Responsive Eye, such as Thomas Hess at Art News, derided Riley and so-called optical art for democratizing and, in his mind, devaluing the aesthetic experience.4 His review labeled Riley’s work as part of international “Op art” — a loose term used to describe works that manipulated visual perception — which was hailed by its proponents for propagating a universal visual experience that transcended national, class, and racial boundaries. Riley resisted this populist characterization and the Op art label for similar reasons as Hess and has, throughout her career, stressed her identity as a painter whose craft is born from within the subjective self.\nRiley’s meteoric rise to fame in 1965 was also fraught with the co-optation of her paintings by the fashion industry, which she neither consented to nor approved. In her defiance, Riley expressed opposing views from many other so-called Op artists at the time — not least, the Hungarian-French artist Victor Vasarely, who openly courted collaborations with textile firms. At every turn, Riley has resisted attempts to pigeonhole her work and rejected associations with European Op art, British Pop art, and even, in the 1970s, feminism. Thus, the appearance of Current on the cover of the catalogue for The Responsive Eye was, from the outset, a double-edged sword: it afforded the piece enormous visibility yet subjected Riley’s oeuvre to populist interpretation.\nAlthough the splash Riley made at MoMA led to a productive expansion of her US career, it was not the first time her paintings had been shown in the United States. Between 1964 and 1966, her work was included in no fewer than sixteen exhibitions at museums and commercial galleries across the country. A letter from Riley to the American educator and photographer Rose Gerlach, dated 1964 (now in the archives of the Yale Center for British Art), reveals Riley’s enthusiasm to promote her work in the United States and her excitement for her forthcoming solo exhibition at Richard Feigen Gallery in 1965.5 Like The Responsive Eye, many of the shows in which Riley’s pieces were included positioned her work within a transcultural network of abstract art, for which the United States was the gateway.\nA number of exhibitions at that time reflected trends in Op art, for example, Motion and Movement in 1964 at the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, and Kinetic and Optic Art Today in 1965 at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo — both of which paralleled The Responsive Eye in prioritizing works that transformed passive spectators into active participants.6 Although as equally international in scope as MoMA’s exhibition, the shows in Cincinnati and Buffalo had a narrower focus. They drew attention to the phenomenon of kinetic art, which had developed through artist networks in Europe, the United States, and Latin America. In contrast, MoMA’s exhibition was ridiculed for conflating multiple practices under the generic “Op” banner. There was much crossover in the artists represented in these three exhibitions, but only the British Riley, the Polish-American Julian Stanczak, and the Japanese-American Tadasuke Kuwayama had work in all three shows — evidence of their remarkable ability to transcend the different but related international groupings included in each exhibition.\n       Expand Figure 2The New Generation exhibition at Whitechapel Gallery, London, 1966  In December 1965, Sidney Janis included a piece by Riley in Pop \u0026amp; Op, an exhibition at his commercial gallery in New York City that aligned these movements through the inspiration they derived from popular culture.7 Yet, whereas Op art in the United States in the mid-1960s denoted internationalism and universalism, Pop art was associated with national identity, its origins considered at the time to be mainly American and British.8 In fact, it was through an association with British Pop art that Riley became known in the United States as a British artist. On numerous occasions, her work was shown within a specifically British context, as part of the cool “new generation” of artists emerging from London’s Royal College of Art — including Patrick Caulfield, David Hockney, Allen Jones, Phillip King, and Richard Smith. Through her inclusion in Bryan Robertson The New Generation exhibition at London’s Whitechapel Gallery in 1964, Riley became associated with this group, despite never fully participating in its vibrant party culture (fig. 2).9 This was the moment when the city gained its reputation for pop music, fashion, and art, drawing the attention of young US audiences and prompting the creation of the iconic Time magazine cover, “London: The Swinging City,” in April 1966.10\n       Expand Figure 3Bridget Riley with Continuum at Gallery One, London, 1963  In 1964 Riley’s work appeared in two US exhibitions about British art. The first was the Albright-Knox Art Gallery’s Contemporary British Painting, a broad showcase from Pop and Op artists to the St. Ives abstractionists and the modernist sculptors Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore.11 Rule Britannia, the second show, took place at the commercial Feigen-Palmer Gallery in Los Angeles, focused on young, emerging artists, and displayed, for the first and only time on US soil, Riley’s walk-through installation Continuum. Continuum is unique in Riley’s oeuvre as the sole independent installation produced by the artist. Designed as a spiral with high walls painted in a variegated black-and-white arrowhead pattern, the work invited audiences to immerse themselves in the pulsing rhythms of Riley’s paintings (fig. 3).\nThe following year, London: The New Scene opened at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, repackaging The New Generation exhibitions in a showcase of thirteen of the “hippest” artists to emerge from London’s pop subcultures.12 Riley showed four of her black-and-white optical paintings — Dilated Centres (1963), Serif (1964), Pause (1964), and Amnesia (1964) — and was the only woman artist to be included (fig. 4). Although The New Scene presented London as a cultural hub, the selected artists embraced US culture and shared similar concerns with American artists about color, optics, commercial techniques, and popular culture — ultimately serving to reinforce the country’s cultural dominance.\n       Expand Figure 4London: The New Scene exhibition at Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, 1965  In 1964, Martin Friedman, the director of the Walker Art Center, asked Riley in a questionnaire to account for the “strong interest” in London among US artists such as Ellsworth Kelly, Barnett Newman, and Kenneth Noland. Riley’s response was succinct: their widespread appeal sprang from “an empathy with the direct statement, the economy of means, a deliberate and reflective aesthetic.”13 That her own work so wholly encapsulated these traits, with their repeating black-and-white forms and provocation of a visual experience preordained by the artist, reveals, in part, why Riley’s work gained such popularity in the United States. So powerfully did her work invite the unmediated visual experience, toward which US Pop, Op, and Color Field painting strived, that it became a must-have for museums and collectors across the country. In the work of this female artist from Britain, audiences experienced the full potential of the US postwar aesthetic: its forceful and forthright appeal to the senses.\nThe solo exhibition of Riley’s work launched by Richard Feigen in 1965 — initially at his New York gallery and later in Chicago and Los Angeles — was key to her market success across the country.14 The buzz around the show spread rapidly to the most prominent US contemporary art collectors, with works selling out before the gallery had even opened its doors to the public. The handwritten lists of collectors who called to buy Riley’s work read like a Who’s Who: Harry Abrams, Betty Blake, James and Lillian Clark, Charles Diker, Philip Johnson, Roy Rothschild Neuberger, and David Winton. Names familiar from the credit lines of museums across the country appear on the yellowed pages of the gallery’s records. Loss (1964) and Where (1964), two works from a series in which Riley varied the tone and dispersal of monochrome dots to create the impression of shifting weight, were among the most requested.\nEmily Hall Tremaine, the influential collector of contemporary art, and her husband, Burton, bought two pieces from Richard Feigen Gallery in 1965: Balm (1964) and Turn (1964). During her lifetime, Tremaine amassed more than four hundred paintings that art historian Robert Rosenblum deemed “so museum-worthy that [her collection] alone could recount to future generations the better part of the story of 20th-century art.”15 Tremaine was also an ardent advocate for the artists she supported. In 1965, she staged an exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Art (now SFMoMA), in which Riley was represented by an untitled silkscreen print lent by Feigen.16 In an accompanying lecture, Tremaine praised Riley’s work for its “intelligence and skill” and compared it to that of the American artist Larry Poons, another “Op artist” she admired.17 Riley’s work, Tremaine declared, was more Apollonian and Poons’s Dionysian — the one more intellectual and the other emotional. Her classical frame of analysis extracted these artists’ works from the of-the-moment faddishness associated with Op art and initiated Riley and Poons into her collection of modern and contemporary art for the ages.\nTremaine was significant for Riley in a further way, for she and her husband owned Piet Mondrian’s final work, Victory Boogie Woogie (1944). Riley went to see it in the Tremaines’ New York apartment when she visited the city for the opening of The Responsive Eye and the Feigen show, reporting to Tremaine that this particular piece was “the greatest influence on her work.”18 Riley is outspoken about her admiration for Mondrian and his ability to combine the particulars of form and color with a universal aesthetic experience, something she has sought to carry into her own work.19 That her love for Mondrian was forged in the United States and in Europe is notable, for, in the former, Mondrian’s work — with all its directness of statement, economy of form, and color precision — was regarded as a forefather of postwar US art as well as a stalwart of European modernism. Riley positioned herself among Mondrian’s disciples and could, perhaps, in New York as nowhere else, see the trajectory of contemporary art: the direct lineage from Mondrian’s surety of form and space to that of the new generation of postwar artists — into which she had been initiated by the patronage of collectors like the Tremaines.\nIn addition to providing opportunities to develop relationships with her collectors, Riley’s 1965 trip afforded her the opportunity to meet and visit the studios of artists she admired. She was reunited there with fellow Briton and friend Allen Jones, who had moved to New York the previous year, and liaised with artists Jasper Johns, Ad Reinhardt, and others. Taken with Johns, Riley arranged to trade one of her “ellipse silkscreen” prints for one of his. Reinhardt showed her around New York City, and Vogue magazine photographed them together at the opening of The Responsive Eye. The next year, Riley collaborated with Reinhardt on the design of an issue of Ian Hamilton Finlay’s poetry magazine Poor Old Tired Horse.20\n       Expand Figure 5Ad Reinhardt, #21, 1958, 1958. Yale University Art Gallery, Gift of Susan Morse Hilles  Also in 1966, when Sam Wagstaff, then curator at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Connecticut, inquired as to whether Reinhardt had met any “interesting English painters” (a question confirming how popular British artists must have been at the time), Reinhardt immediately put forward Riley.21 Riley’s Drift and Deny series, both produced in 1966 when she was back in Britain, are in dialogue with Reinhardt’s work from the late 1950s and early 1960s in the way they experiment with the dynamics of two similar tones of blue or gray, much as in paintings like #21, 1958 by Reinhardt (fig. 5). This suggests that Riley’s time in the United States looking at art and talking to artists deepened her interrogation of color relationships and complicated the questions she wished to ask of them. Riley clearly wanted her new work to be seen alongside that of her US peers. When asked by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery’s patron Seymour H. Knox Jr. and its director, Gordon Smith, to choose a work for the collection, she selected Drift 2. Smith wrote to Riley expressing his and Knox’s excitement at having a work that she had “chosen [herself] to represent [her] paintings.”22 After the enormous success of her black-and-white paintings in 1964 and 1965, her decision to send the gallery Drift 2 signaled to US audiences that her oeuvre was developing and a preoccupation with color relationships was to be her priority in the future. While works like Movement in Squares (1962) and Turn manipulated basic geometric forms (a square and a triangle) to create the impression of directional movement, Drift 2 settled on the uniform unit of the curve but varied the tones within curves to explore the instability and relativity of color perception.\nBy 1967, Riley had broken into full color with works such as Chant 2, Cataract 3, and Late Morning 1, organized around a tripartite system of two complementary colors with a third disruptive color that agitates the visual field and creates movement. These color paintings were among the new pieces that Riley showed in the British Pavilion at the 34th Venice Biennale in 1968, where she became the first woman to win the international prize for painting (fig. 6).23 As news of the award disseminated through press channels around the world, it amplified her fame globally. Also exhibiting at the British Pavilion was the sculptor Phillip King, whose steel structures shared formal and conceptual parallels with US Minimalism.\n       Expand Figure 6British Pavilion for the XXXIV Venice Biennale, 1968  That the British Council, which managed the selection, should choose two artists with a proven record of success in US exhibitions and whose work had affinities with postwar art in the United States is indicative of complex underlying politics. The Biennale, with its individually housed pavilions representing nation-states, had long become a microcosm of international relations. The selection of artists put forward by each country became symbols of its values as well as its artistic prowess. The exhibition of Riley and King aligned British and US aesthetics and, by extension, their values. At the same time, it flaunted Britain’s competitive cultural edge by presenting two artists who had broken into the US art market.\nConcurrent with her exhibition in Venice, Riley’s work was also included in Documenta 4, the international exhibition held every four years in Kassel, Germany.24 The fourth edition gained the slogan, “the youngest Documenta ever,” because a committee of young curators was appointed to ensure democratic selection processes and promote the exhibition’s relevance.25 For the first year since the exhibition’s inception, retrospectives were abandoned; the art had to be recent or specially commissioned. The result was an exhibition dominated by artists from the United States, with Pop, Op, Minimalism, and Color Field painting taking center stage.\n       Expand Figure 7James Rosenquist, Fire Slide, 1967, at Documenta 4, 1968, in Kassel, West Germany  James Rosenquist’s Fire Slide (1967), which covered a double-height wall by the staircase, was one of the most talked-about pieces, exemplifying the enormous scale of US art, and it became a focal point for Documenta’s predominantly European audiences (fig. 7). Although Fragments (1964), the series of screen prints on Plexiglas that Riley exhibited at Documenta, did not match the scale of work by her US counterparts, it showed off her talent at utilizing commercial printing techniques and new materials — both important components of contemporary art in the United States.\nIn contrast, the works Riley produced for the Venice Biennale did compete in scale with US paintings. In Late Morning and Late Morning 1, Riley abandoned her modest square format for larger canvases (approximately 89 x 142 and 90 x 90 inches, respectively), which enhanced viewing experiences. While visiting New York in 1965, Riley had seen for herself the spacious but affordable loft studios that allowed her peers to work on such a great scale. Recognizing this deficiency in studio spaces in England, she cofounded (with Peter Sedgley) Space Studios in 1968, to assist artists in finding affordable studio spaces. Riley encouraged artists to think big, as she herself had after experiencing the absorbing impact of large paintings in the United States. The display of Fragments at Documenta demonstrated Riley’s affinity with US aesthetics and materials, but her paintings at the British Pavilion are what made a statement to the world that she could match the very best of US art in talent, exposure, and scale.\nThe Venice Biennale marked a high point in Riley’s international career to date, after which a lacuna of nearly a decade elapsed without an exhibition at a US gallery or museum. This interval was noted by Robertson in a 1975 review for Art in America of the first of two solo exhibitions of Riley’s recent work at Sidney Janis Gallery in New York (the second was in 1978).26 He pointed out that since her last show at Richard Feigen Gallery in 1967, US audiences had mainly consumed her work through reproductions, likely those of high-profile pieces such as Current and Late Morning. The result, he lamented, was that by the mid-1970s, “three-quarters of her life’s work [remained] unknown in America.”27\nWhat is more, Riley’s paintings were still broadly associated with Op art, which, after a brief period of popularity in the 1960s, lost its appeal among US audiences. So, too, had the craze for British artists, as the New York art scene increasingly turned in on itself and London’s “swinging” reputation diminished in the face of the city’s economic decline. Neither Riley’s reputation as an Op artist nor her place in the “new generation” of British art truly captured the breadth and depth of her practice. As Robertson attested, however, the exhibition at Sidney Janis Gallery began to address this lack of knowledge about her wider oeuvre by highlighting her intense relationship with nature and varied art-historical influences — including the interest she displayed in Chinese scroll paintings in works like Ch’i Yün (1974) and Shih Li (1975).\nThe retrospective exhibition of Riley’s work mounted by the British Council in 1978 (and traveling until 1980) provided an opportunity to engage US audiences with the entire scope of her work. Riley traveled to Buffalo for the installation at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery and later wrote to the museum’s director, Robert Buck Jr., to express her hope that the exhibition would reframe her work in the United States:\n Since leaving Buffalo, from time to time I have been wondering how people will respond to my work now. It is curious that whilst my name is known, very few people know my work. So I hope this exhibition may redress the balance a little and that the vulgarity etc: associated with that awful populist “Op” label will be sufficiently distant to allow people to look more freely and see my painting for themselves.28\n A review in the New York Times by Riley’s good friend John Russell suggests that her plea was successful. As Russell reported, the “Riley retrospective made it clear all over again that her connexion with Op Art was no more than coincidental.”29 The inclination to hold her work up to that of US artists remained, however, and Russell compared her large horizontal canvas Apprehend (1971) to Kenneth Noland’s similarly sized striped painting, Wild Indigo (1967), also on display at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery (fig. 8). Interesting to note, Russell drew the same conclusion as Tremaine in her comparison of Riley with Poons, describing Riley’s work as “impersonal” and governed by an “ordered precision,” while Noland’s was considered “impetuous” and “wayward,” with an “outrageous ripeness.”30 Whether laced with a gender bias that singled out Riley’s “objectivity” as unusual in a woman artist, or as part of a nationalistic endeavor to connect US artists back to Abstract Expressionism, or simply based on observation, Riley emerged from the comparison as an equal — an artist who, Russell concluded, would be “welcomed the world over.”31\n       Expand Figure 8Kenneth Noland, Wild Indigo, 1967. Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York, Charles Clifton Fund, 1972  Although the British Council retrospective opened the doors to a more sustained and in-depth appreciation of Riley’s oeuvre in the United States, interest in her work has never again reached the heights it did in the mid to late 1960s. In part, this is to be explained by its continued alignment with Op art, but other factors might also have contributed. Riley was one of very few international female artists to gain widespread coverage from New York’s male-dominated art establishment in the 1960s. However, the rise of the feminist art movement in the early 1970s put gender at the forefront of artistic practice and brought about a series of cooperatives and networks — such as A.I.R. Gallery, founded in 1972 — through which female artists could gain visibility. Riley distanced herself from the feminist art movement in her short article “The Hermaphrodite” (1973), writing that “women’s liberation, when applied to artists, seems to me to be a naïve concept,” a “hysteria, [which] artists who happen to be women need . . . like they need a hole in the head.”32 This unwillingness to subsume perceived artistic independence under the political moment may have had an adverse impact on Riley’s popularity in the United States and limited the channels through which her work could be seen.\nThe postmodern turn in scholarship in the 1980s did, however, afford renewed attention to her work among US-based art historians, including Richard Shiff and Jonathan Crary. A handful of commercial galleries in New York City, including Jeffrey Hoffeld, Sidney Janis, and Pace Wildenstein, continued to mount shows of her recent work. In 2001, the Dia Center for the Arts in New York gave Riley her first US museum exhibition since the traveling British Council retrospective (fig. 9). As the title Reconnaissance implied, the show offered a new generation of audiences a preliminary survey of Riley’s work, mainly from the 1960s and 1970s, paving the way for the YCBA’s larger, more complete retrospective.33\n       Expand Figure 9Bridget Riley: Reconnaisance exhibition at Dia Center for the Arts, 2001  When William Seitz put Current on the catalogue cover of The Responsive Eye, it was an attempt to situate the work in the present moment, as a product of contemporary concerns. More than 50 years later, however, the work still retains its potency, simultaneously capturing the sensorial overload of abstract art in the mid-1960s and the meticulous workmanship of an artist who has remained steadfast in her craft. Riley’s work continues to captivate audiences around the world, transcending national and international categorizations through the clarity of her vision and unwavering commitment to communicating that vision through color and form.\nRachel Stratton is Postdoctoral Research Associate, Yale Center for British Art. notes    See William C.

He introduced himself and said that he had come to tell me about an exhibition he was organizing for the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York to show the use of perception in the figurative painting of the past and the abstract painting of the present day. This was a very exciting premise for an exhibition and one that appealed to me immediately, as it crossed the same boundary that I had crossed in my own work and by the same bridge, perception.\n       Expand Figure 1Bridget Riley in her Warwick Road studio, London, 1964  At that time I had pinned up in the studio a large reproduction of Georges Seurat’s A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, a detail of the upper half of Piero della Francesca’s Madonna del Parto, and a Ben Day dot poster from the United States. My first abstract painting, Kiss, hung on a wall nearby and leaning up against another wall was my just completed curve painting, Current, along with a large group of black-and-white working drawings. Bill Seitz asked if he could have this new curve painting for his exhibition. I was delighted, and so Current duly left the studio for New York.\nLater I learned that Philip Johnson, the American architect, bought Current and presented it to MoMA. He had visited my second exhibition at Gallery One in London the previous year and bought Fission, later giving it to MoMA. Although this gift may well have led to Bill’s visit, I don’t think it was the only connection. George Rickey, the American kinetic artist who used natural forces such as wind and gravity in his sculpture, also knew of my paintings and had bought a small piece of mine. I later met George and his wife when he was in West Berlin taking part in DAAD, an international artist-in-residence scheme.\nI remember seeing a photograph of American artists in which Rickey is standing next to Ad Reinhardt outside MoMA in New York, demanding attention. To us in London, MoMA had the “crown jewels” of the modern movement in art. We regarded it as a place of pilgrimage, that is, if one were fortunate enough to get to New York in the first place!\nIt was well known that many distinguished artists had sought and been granted refuge from persecution in the United States and that they had brought with them a lively sense of avant-garde practice. Art was no longer just something that happened elsewhere but was there, living and vigorous in their midst. Recognizing this, Jackson Pollock had answered a questionnaire, which was published in Art and Architecture in 1944. The questioner was anonymous, later understood to probably have been Robert Motherwell.\n Q: Do you find it important that many famous European artists are living in this country?\n  JP: Yes. I accept the fact that many of the most important paintings of the last hundred years have been made in France. American painters have generally missed the point of modern painting — from beginning to end. . . .\n  Q: Do you think there can be a purely American art?\n  JP:\tThe idea of an isolated American painting, so popular in this country during the thirties seems absurd to me, just as the idea of creating a purely American mathematics or physics would seem absurd. . . . And in another sense, the problem doesn’t exist at all; or, if it did, would solve itself: An American is an American and his painting would naturally be qualified by that fact, whether he wills it or not. But the basic problems of contemporary painting are independent of any one country.1\n In the late 1950s, the Tate Gallery held two exhibitions of American painting to which we all went and which were very much discussed. We were eager to see more of the work of American artists and were able to do so at the Whitechapel Gallery of which Bryan Robertson was director. I saw there Jackson Pollock’s deeply moving exhibition (fig. 2) and Mark Rothko’s hauntingly beautiful paintings. These were followed a little later by exhibitions of Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns.\n       Expand Figure 2Jackson Pollock (curated by Bryan Robertson) at Whitechapel Gallery, London, 1958  There had also just arrived in London a new acquisition at the National Gallery of a late waterlily painting by Claude Monet. I was thrilled to discover that Bill Seitz had been one of the small group sent by MoMA to visit Monet’s studio at Giverny soon after the end of the war and had in 1960 curated for MoMA Seasons and Moments, a touring exhibition of Monet’s paintings, reports of which sent shock waves through the art world on both sides of the Atlantic (fig. 3). He wrote for the catalogue, introducing Monet’s life and work to a wider audience and focusing in particular on the artist’s late waterlily paintings.2 These monumental paintings, sometimes across two or three canvases at a time, had been discovered by MoMA’s team in Monet’s war-battered studio in Giverny. André Masson, one of the well-known European artists resident in the United States, described Monet’s water landscapes in the Musée de l’Orangerie in Paris as “the Sistine Chapel of Impressionism.”3\n       Expand Figure 3Claude Monet: Seasons and Monuments (curated by William Seitz) at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1960  The waterlily paintings resonated with me for both aesthetic and personal reasons. It just so happened that during the 1950s my parents — reunited after the war and returned to Lincolnshire — bought a disused watermill, which they renovated and turned into our family home. Now there was water everywhere: rivers, canals, streams, torrents, pools, ponds, and, of course, reflections — shining, sparkling, glittering, moving, flowing. It brought Monet vividly to life not only for me but for the whole family. I spent as much time as I could painting and drawing there.\nInevitably, I longed to see Monet’s great waterlily installation in Paris, which he had worked on during the final decades of his life. In 1954 I flew with my sister, Sally, and two friends to Orly to see it at l’Orangerie. The installation was understandably in a sorry state, the galleries dark and gloomy with only one or two visitors and a keeper who followed us around. But even in that state the paintings were glorious, the greatness and grandeur clearly apparent. This visit made a deep impression on me, and I drew inspiration from it ten years later in making Continuum, a painted environment in which the viewer is surrounded by the image. Continuum was included in my second exhibition at Gallery One (see Stratton essay, fig. 3).\nWilliam Seitz came a second time to see me at the Warwick Road studio. He was returning from a visit to Italy where he had been with his wife, who was unwell, to see their favorite Italian Renaissance paintings. I asked if he thought that art could help in such situations and he replied, “Yes, I am sure of it.” I always remembered this. We talked about Piero della Francesca. He asked me if there was anyone I would like to meet in New York when I came over for the opening of his exhibition. I said I would love to meet Mark Rothko, remembering the beautiful exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery that Bryan had put on (fig. 4). He said he knew Mark well and thought that this could be arranged. He asked me if I knew Jesus Raphael Soto, the South American artist, because he wanted to include him in his exhibition. I said, “Unfortunately, only by name but I know that he lived and worked in Paris before the war.”\n       Expand Figure 4Mark Rothko (curated by Bryan Robertson) at Whitechapel Gallery, London, 1961  We talked about “perceptual abstraction,” the name that Bill preferred for the new movement he was launching. He said, “This is an opportunity to get the name right,” adding, “all too often in the history of modern art, artists have had titles attached to their work which have little or nothing to do with it.”\nAlthough the exhibition was still some way off, it was beginning to be talked about with a certain amount of speculation. Just before I left for New York, a supportive critic, William Packer, who wrote for Financial Times, said to me, “I hope it goes all right over there.” This seemed rather strange to me. Why should it not? But I must admit I was surprised that I had heard nothing from Bill Seitz. I didn’t know, for instance, that the exhibition was to be called The Responsive Eye or that my painting, Current, would be on the cover of the catalogue.\nThe interest in perception was international and, in every case, had stemmed from nineteenth-century Paris. Although the two World Wars had interrupted its growth and development, the avant-garde in many countries (in South America as in Eastern Europe) pursued it with intelligence and enthusiasm — producing remarkably similar works of art, which simply showed how strong and well-founded the initial stimulus was. When the term “optical mixture,” or rather mélange optique (as it was called in France), entered the world of studio talk, it signaled an important shift: the significance of the viewer rose to conscious recognition and with it a new, wider audience emerged.\nBill Seitz was as good as his word and, although I hardly saw him during the opening period of The Responsive Eye (fig. 5), he extended an invitation to dine with him in his old studio. I was delighted to discover that he had been a painter too. This studio was a characteristic New York loft apartment with a large window at the end of a long narrow space. Above the bookshelves lining the walls were some small canvases that showed a great feeling for Pierre Bonnard.\n       Expand Figure 5The Responsive Eye (curated by William Seitz) at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1965, with Bridget Riley’s Hesitate at the end of the corridor  Bill said that he and Rothko both loved Bonnard and had studied his work. I was even more delighted by this as I also admired Bonnard and had tried to copy one of his paintings. I had just sat down at the table by the window when the doorbell rang, and Bill opened the door to Mark Rothko. He came in and stopped dead when he saw me. He turned to Bill and said, “You didn’t tell me she would be here!” Bill said, “It’s all right, Mark. Bridget loves your work, she only wants to meet you.” Mark looked doubtful, even disbelieving, and turned to go. Bill said, “Don’t go,” and put his hand on Mark’s arm. All this was very embarrassing and painful and so, to ease matters, I said, “No, it’s my mistake. It was impertinent of me to ask to see you, but when Bill asked me in London if there was anyone I would like to meet when I came to New York, I chose you because I had seen your work at Whitechapel Gallery and loved it. I am so sorry. I had better go.” At this, Bill put his hand on my arm and said, “No, you stay.” Then he turned again to Mark and began to remonstrate, explaining that I had seen his show and only wanted to tell him. But Mark interrupted. “She’s like all the others,” he said, “she just wants to push me out.”\nThis remark was shocking. I protested that this was not the case at all and in fact I very greatly admired his work and use of color and now felt especially close to him through a shared love of French painting, which I had just discovered on this very visit to Bill’s studio. This did go some way to reassure him and, after ever quieter exchanges, we sat down and talked more and more easily. He told me how much he had enjoyed his visit to London, and we learned we both appreciated Bryan Robertson’s gift for hanging paintings. I told him that in England his work was greatly admired and respected. Bryan always tried to understand what artists were trying to do, especially when he was showing their work. He took a great deal of trouble with Mark’s show because the artist wanted a particularly low level of light. Bryan managed to achieve this, and Mark’s colors deepened and glowed, appearing to float free of the picture plane. Mark was delighted by Bryan’s skill and wrote later to inquire about the precise spacing between the paintings.\nBill was very pleased and relieved by the way the evening developed, and we parted with promises to meet again and good wishes. Sadly, I never saw Bill again. Unfortunately, he was in grave trouble at MoMA, which I didn’t know about, and he resigned, leaving New York for good. However, he wrote an essay for American Vogue in which he deplored the reception accorded to The Responsive Eye, claiming that what had been missed was a movement as significant to the development of modern art as Cubism had been and stating his belief in the validity of its thesis.4\nOn my next visit to New York, I saw Mark Rothko again. The American sculptor Louise Nevelson gave a party for me to which she invited Mark, and we renewed our conversation about England and about Bryan Robertson. I had the feeling that his work was going well; he seemed more confident and certainly happier with life in general.\nBack in my Warwick Road studio, I got on with my work, continuing to develop the use of grays and colored grays, and pushed on toward color. Encouraged by critics and supporters in England, I wrote “Perception is the Medium,” published in Art News in October 1965.5\nI returned to the United States in the autumn of 1965 for a show in Los Angeles with Feigen Palmer — of which I have many happy memories. I visited Las Vegas with Patrick Proctor and David Hockney and was entertained by the actor Dennis Hopper, who, although a fervent collector of surrealism, took a considerable interest in me and my work. Tony Curtis bought Shiver and often carried the painting with him on his travels in a bespoke leather suitcase he had made to accommodate it.\nMeanwhile, MoMA had prepared the exhibition Bridget Riley: Drawings, which circulated in the United States in 1966. Gene Baro, the American critic, reviewed it for Studio International in July, subtitling his article “Drawing for Painting” and reproducing many of the works. As Baro put it,\n Bridget Riley’s paintings are visual events. They are not images; they are not symbols; they are actions; and the artistic intention is that they offer a visual equivalent to psycho-physical states. The ideal response to these paintings would perhaps be unconscious — a sense of inexplicable identification with their inner dynamics.6  notes    Anonymous, “Jackson Pollock: A Questionnaire,” Arts and Architecture 61, no. 2 (February 1944): 14.

Born in Britain in 1931, and internationally recognized as one of the most important and influential artists living today, Riley has built a prolific career. Yet her exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art is the artist’s first major survey in the United States in more than two decades.1 One may ask why a well-respected artist — whose introduction to international audiences came by way of her inclusion in the pivotal 1965 exhibition The Responsive Eye at New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) — should be relatively absent from the exhibition schedules of museums across the United States. Perhaps Riley imposed her own exile?\nOne of the consequences of Op art in the 1960s was the media hype surrounding it, which led to the reproduction of patterns from Riley’s paintings on fabrics for dresses featured in Madison Avenue’s shop windows. Her works were commodified for faddish, fast fashion, and the artist predicted it would “take at least twenty years before anyone [looked] at [her] paintings seriously again.” Her inclusion in subsequent US and British exhibitions proved this prediction false — her work was included in Documenta 4 and won the international prize in painting at the 1968 Venice Biennale. (Riley was the first woman and first Briton to receive the award.) Yet her assumption made her initial visit to New York in 1965 a formative experience. Although it was tempered by “the enormous warmth” she received from her US contemporaries, she associated the trip with “feelings of violation and disillusionment.”2 It is this origin story that begins our exhibition.\nSpanning two floors of the Center, the exhibition Perceptual Abstraction separates Riley’s early black-and-white and gray tonal paintings (1961–68) from her works in color (1967–2022). The third floor, where the exhibition begins, introduces the germinal geometric abstractions shown at Riley’s first solo exhibitions in London and paintings produced at the height of her early US exposure.\nHer black-and-white pieces signaled Riley’s first explorations with a range of forms: curves, disks, bands, tessellated triangles, and chevrons (or “zigs,” as the artist calls them), some of which recur in later works in color. As Riley observed, in contrast to later paintings like Rêve (1999) or Enchant (2004), which each open an interior space within the layered, shallow depths of the picture plane, her earlier pieces activate the space between the work and the spectator.\n       Expand   Bridget Riley, Movement in Squares, 1961.Arts Council Collection, Southbank Centre          Expand   Bridget Riley, Rêve, 1999.Courtesy of the artist     Diverging from the austere achromatism of the works from Riley’s early period, the second floor is flooded with color and light. “Color,” the artist explains, “is the one material through which everything is brought into existence,”3 achieved by her studied handling of it on a large, impressive scale: the paintings envelop and encompass viewers.4 As early as 1972, Riley described the spatial and perceptual relationship between viewer and work as an “area of activity — of light.”5 In color the sensation of light is fully exploited by the artist, produced by formal and intuitive relationships between color and form. As William Seitz observed in 1965, Riley was already investigating the effects of fugitive color in her black-and-white paintings, engendered by the contraction and expansion of drawn line and form and by their opposing forces of “stabilities and instabilities, certainties and uncertainties.”6 Seitz describes how our eyes are “bombarded with pure energy” upon viewing Current, which results in “effects of color . . . usually pale pink, gold, or blue.”7\nRiley expanded her palette of grays suffused with subtle warm and cool tones, in works such as Arrest 2 (1965) and Deny 1 (1966), into color — beginning with Late Morning and Chant 2, exhibited in 1968 at the Venice Biennale. Periodically returning to significant forms the artist explored from 1964 onward, the paintings and works on paper displayed on this floor showcase the connections between Riley’s early and later practices.\n       Expand   Bridget Riley, Arrest 2, 1965.The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (Purchase, acquired through the generosity of the William T. Kemper Foundation Commerce Bank, Trustee), 2001.1          Expand   Bridget Riley, Late Morning 1, 1967.Courtesy of the artist     Riley’s early exploration of the shaped canvas, her use of forms like disks and chevrons, and a shift to monumental scale were concurrent with similar developments in work by contemporaries such as Ad Reinhardt, Kenneth Noland, and Larry Poons. Yet these affinities end with Riley’s careful consideration of the perceptual effects of color. Evident throughout Riley’s career is a sustained study of her own practice, as she returns to distinct formal concerns explored in her earliest abstractions. “Every painter has a long conversation with their work,” she has remarked, “and the longer that you live, the conversation goes on stretching far back. So it’s a reconnoiter for me.”8\nWhat follows is an overview of Riley’s oeuvre. The works in the exhibition trace her exploration of black and white as formal, sensorial absolutes, beginning in 1961; her experiments with tonal modulations, shifting from chromatic restraint to liberated, saturated color from 1967 onward; and the spatiality, movement, sensation of light, and “stabilities and instabilities” of line and form that have remained steadfast throughout her practice. For Riley, this exhibition is conceived as a response to her US reception; it includes paintings purchased by US collectors as well as works from her own collection that have been exhibited in key shows throughout the United States and the United Kingdom. The selection points to significant developments in Riley’s oeuvre, which converge with and diverge from that of her contemporaries. Absolutes: Black Is Not White\nAfter her trip to New York in 1965 for the exhibition The Responsive Eye at MoMA, Riley began to describe her use of space as “more American than English,” that is, as a shallow, “non-focal” space that she felt “originated with [Piet] Mondrian and was first completely articulated by [Jackson] Pollock.”9 It was the unfocused, nonhierarchical handling of composition, form, and space that galvanized the artist’s first experiments in abstraction, and this allover quality is central to Riley’s black-and-white paintings.\nThe exhibition begins with Riley’s breakthrough work of 1961, Movement in Squares, the first painting to fully engage with a gridded sequence of geometric forms. Using the simple unit of the square but compressing its width toward the center, the painting appears to fold in on itself — a startling perceptual effect that set the tone for the black-and-white paintings that followed.

The emphasis on spatiality beyond the painting’s boundaries appealed to Riley, and these works accentuated the material autonomy of painting-as-object,10 yet she abandoned the shaped canvas shortly afterward, only returning to this format in 2012.11 Riley instead became interested in the relationships among forms, the absolutes of black and white, and the viewer’s perception of space and movement. Working with a scaffolding of formal elements and structures allowed Riley to generate “visual sensations, but certainly not to the exclusion of emotion,” she explains.12 “One of my aims is that these two responses shall be experienced as one and the same.”13 For example, a circle becomes a rotating, vibrating vortex in Blaze 4 (1964), and the slow humming lines of Horizontal Vibration (1961) present “a fluctuating surface” that “operates like the action of a whip.”14 From the tensions in these formal constitutions and limitations, visual effects and emotional states arise, akin to the bodily and perceptual experiences one feels in nature.\nWith Exposure (1966), Riley expanded to a landscape format, in which curved, compact black lines undulate in equal rhythmic measure, creating a luminous energy that vibrates across and beyond the canvas — a “shallow push-pull situation” between the spectator and the painting.15 For Riley, the space between is where the painting occurs, achieved by her repetitive, dense use of line that conveys an unstable movement, hovering between the viewer and the marked, material form.\n       Expand Bridget Riley, Exposure, 1966.Guggenheim Abu Dhabi  Reviewing Riley’s 1966 solo exhibition at Richard Feigen Gallery in New York, where Exposure was first shown, critic Rosalind Krauss found that the artist’s “pictorial notions derived unquestionably from the canons of all-overness established by advanced American art of the 1950s.”16 For Riley, as for Pollock, the absence of a center within the picture plane could generate new sensational experiences that a compositional focal point could not. Yet, in contrast to Krauss’s assumption, Riley felt indebted to the allover spatiality of Mondrian — Pollock was merely another of his disciples. A prolific writer, Riley has rarely pointed to contemporaries as influential to her as Georges Seurat, Piet Mondrian, or Eugène Delacroix.17 As an addendum to the exhibition, Riley selected a study by John Constable and a watercolor by Delacroix to signal the importance of historical art to her practice. Although her study of color and light began with works by nineteenth-century European artists, it was also influenced by the traditions of Chinese scroll painting, ancient Egyptian funerary art, Indian temple facades, and Persian miniatures.\nThe new “perceptual abstraction” — Seitz’s term for Op art — was characterized as too European, even as anti-American art, by critics such as Krauss, Thomas Hess, Lucy Lippard, and Barbara Rose and by artists Donald Judd and Frank Stella (whose work, criticism notwithstanding, was also included in The Responsive Eye). A 1964 interview with Stella and Judd, raising questions about Op art, was overshadowed by discussions of differences between European and US abstraction. European modernism was perceived as old-fashioned, “a kind of curiosity — very dreary,” according to Stella.18 Riley considered her work indebted, in part, to Neoplastic Constructivism, unlike Judd, who was adamant that he had never been influenced by the Bauhaus (“too long ago to think about,” he said19); instead, he looked to his contemporaries in the United States.20\nBoth Judd and Stella outlined what they felt was a thoroughly European visual language: illusionism, an emphasis on symmetry, balanced composition, and small-scale supports. Judd found that “those effects tend to carry with them all the structures, values, feelings of the whole European tradition.”21 Following a line of rationalistic thinking that began with the philosopher René Descartes, Judd held that European abstraction was overly composed — focused on parts to make a whole, rather than focused on an autonomous object. Riley, like Judd, was considering similar formal views of European and US abstraction. In naming her use of space “American” — “open space, shallow space, multifocal space” — she was positioning it in opposition to “centralised European space, the focally centred situation of the European tradition.”22\nThe lack of a center or central focal point, as Riley astutely observed, was the distinguishing dynamic of modern art, originating from the gradual elimination of spiritual contexts like religion and mythology that once framed painting’s conventions. This shift led modern artists to work with an uncertainty of visual meaning and fixed reality, to begin from a “placelessness” and an openness to interpretation,23 which was the new, postwar humanism: “Our bearings still suffer from the concept or suppositions of Renaissance theory, which is ‘man as the measure of all things,’” Riley stated in 1971.24 “But man is only a part of a bigger whole and this whole is neither centripetal nor centrifugal. It is much more egalitarian.”25 Riley finds the framework for spiritual contexts — once found outside the arena of painting, in our external reality — within the mechanics of painting itself.\nIn conversation with David Sylvester in 1967, Riley said there are “colossal energies involved” in her paintings, “in the medium . . . in the units, intervals and lines.”26 Unlike Pollock’s proclamation, “I am nature,” which translated materially onto canvas as the individualistic, energetic mark of the artist’s hand, Riley’s concern is with the energy manifested from within the formal relationships established in painting: “It’s the recognition of the sensation without the actual incident which prompted it,” she explained in conversation with Andrew Graham-Dixon.27 Repetitive forms and structures that express energetic, emotional states are constant in Riley’s early paintings, but the lack of a center remains consistent throughout her oeuvre.\nRiley met Ad Reinhardt at a dinner hosted in London by then Whitechapel director Bryan Robertson and encountered him again during her trip to New York for The Responsive Eye. In 1966, the two artists collaborated on an issue of Ian Hamilton Finlay’s Poor Old Tired Horse, pairing Reinhardt’s black letter poetry with Riley’s drawn elliptical forms. “There is just one image, one imagelessness, one plane, one depth, one flatness, one color, one colorlessness, one light, one space, one time, one timelessness” Reinhardt wrote in that issue of the journal.28 The repetitive structure of Reinhardt’s poem is a textual equivalence to the gridded, uncentered quality of the paintings such as Deny 1 that Riley produced during this period.\nDuring this time, Riley also abandoned the absolutes of black and white and began exploring gray tonalities, introducing colored grays and blues. She explored movement based on the interaction between formal elements: ellipticals first occur as tonal disks, transforming into stretched ovals in Hesitate (1964), a work also included in The Responsive Eye. Arrest 2 and Deny 1 depart from the monotonality of Hesitate through Riley’s introduction of warm and cool tones. The thinness and thickness of line and the “movement” of the ovals marked a new breakthrough for Riley.\n       Expand   Bridget Riley, Hesitate, 1964.Tate: Presented by the Friends of the Tate Gallery, 1985          Expand   Bridget Riley, Deny 1, 1966.JPMorgan Chase Art Collection     She calls the elliptical a “directional circle” — “light” and “fast” at its ends, but “heavy and static” in the middle.29 The elliptical form offers repetition with constant variation, with the centered oval opening of each ellipse remaining fixed while its black-lipped envelope rotates on its axis. Like Reinhardt, Riley describes the latent forces within her own paintings as opposing energies.30 Elements in her paintings are paradoxically constant and destructive, she writes, and “as a result of the cyclic movement of repose, disturbance and repose, the original situation is re-stated.”31 Ellipticals in Deny 1 move as their axes rotate, but movement is also facilitated by cool grays set in motion against the warmth of the ground as their saturation shifts from light to dark and vice versa. Riley later described this group of paintings as growing out of and in opposition to the binaries of black and white, as a way of finding “something which operated on more levels, was capable of more development, had a more grey’d quality, like the indeterminate nature of reality.”32\nRiley returns again and again to the significance of the landscape of Cornwall, her childhood home, as the inception of her visual world. Of the equivalences between its landscape and her formal considerations of color and form, she describes “a wide range of subtle shades of greys, warm and cold-coloured greys in the slate of the rocks and stone walls, the colours of the sea, the sky, and the mists that are never far away.”33 “For me,” Bridget Riley wrote in 1977, “nature is not landscape, but the dynamism of visual forces — an event rather than an appearance.”34 Into Color\nIn her black-and-white paintings, Riley was already thinking about optical mixing and perceptual color, made manifest in Hesitate, in the subtle cool- and warm-hued ellipses of the Deny series and in the suite of screen prints Untitled (Nineteen Greys) (1968). Her first foray into full color, with the Late Morning and Chant series, abandoned grayed disks for vertical or horizontal bands of color. Although Riley’s rejection of forms like the disk or circle was a formal decision (one she would return to in the 2017 series Measure for Measure), it was perhaps partly driven by the critical responses to The Responsive Eye, which found perceptual abstraction dependent on pictorial space and “trompe-l’oeil illusionism.”35 This was one criticism lobbied at Riley’s work that she felt inclined to set right in her essay “Perception is the Medium,” published in 1965: “Trompe-l’oeil . . . is no more relevant to my intentions than the blueness of the sky is relevant to a blue mark in an Abstract-Expressionist painting.”36\n       Expand Bridget Riley, Late Morning, 1967–68.Tate: Purchased 1968  British critic Lawrence Alloway criticized the responses to the exhibition for their formalist, Greenbergian insistence that recognizable forms and geometric shapes were antithetical to the purity of the truly abstract: “Circles have an iconography; images become motives with histories.”37 Unless they are situated as gridded, repetitive structures, like those in Black to White Discs (1962), circles also have centers, which become focal points, as seen in the fluctuating surfaces of Uneasy Centre (1963) and Blaze 4 (1964). As Riley states with regard to the use of forms with such motives, “You can’t of course build with associations. . . . For me this means I don’t begin with the appearance of form and colors as such, but with their spatial properties.”38\nBeing British is not the same as being European, but the critical reception of The Responsive Eye and US exhibitions of contemporary British art that proliferated at the same time conflated British abstraction with European abstraction. It was and had often been the case that US and British critics felt British modernists were, for far too long, influenced by the art of the European continent and were ignoring their own local traditions.39 Yet, reviewers of exhibitions of contemporary British art in the United States and in Britain also faulted British artists for being too “literary,” too illustrative, too “fussy and provincial” — terms often associated with the perceived flaws of British modernism.40 Riley, although indebted to the actual landscapes of Cornwall, never described herself as an inheritor of the British landscape painting traditions of Constable and J.M.W. Turner. Yet, David Thompson found that even “the best of the new British painting, for all its confident internationalism, has not lost all its British characteristics. . . . It is generally cautious about color, and relies on fantasy or allusive reference more than it does on the sensuous, material, physical aspects of art.”41\nIndeed, Riley’s initial exploration of color began cautiously. She had determined that “the basis of colour is instability,” and line a “neutral” vehicle with which to build a fluctuating field of color.42 Vertical, horizontal, and curved lines characterize Riley’s primary visual language from 1967 through the 1970s. The first color paintings are restricted to two or three colors interrupted by white — red and blue in Chant 2, with the addition of green in Late Morning. Originally developed as a cartoon in 1973 and fully realized in 2003, Elysium, rendered in thin, vertical bands of alternating magenta, turquoise, olive, and white, indicates Riley’s unceasing reflection on previous studies and paintings — as with Vapour 3 (1970/2009), which continues from a series of paintings begun in 1970. Elysium extends the exploration of color relationships and their potential to emanate light, originally begun in Chant 2 and Late Morning, but unlike the intensity conveyed in the earlier paintings, Elysium produces a softer glow.\n       Expand Bridget Riley, Elysium, 2003/1973.The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Purchase, Lila Acheson Wallace Gift, 2016  “Delacroix,” Riley observed, “was convinced there were always three colours perceptually present in what we see.”43 This fugitivity of color was inspired, as Riley posits, by his visits to North Africa, where he noticed that folds of white cloth in bright sunlight carried violet shadows, and with them, the afterimages of green and yellow. Chant 2 illustrates this optical mixture between the vertical blue-and-red stripes on the white ground, emitting two different violets interrupted by yellow. The horizontal stripes of orange, violet, and green in Rise 2 (1970) and the verticality of Vapour 3 emanate iridescent optical mixtures more diffuse than in Chant 2 or Late Morning. As the artist observed of the Vapour series, it recalls “the fugitive quality of something which is obscure or difficult to penetrate. A vapour or a mist veils or hides something. It de-materializes the material and has a beauty all of its own.”44\n       Expand Bridget Riley, Rise 2, 1970.Dallas Museum of Art, Foundation for the Arts Collection, gift of Mr. and Mrs. James H. Clark  Like Delacroix, Riley found her own equivalences of spectral color in nature: for example, the rippled green and blue-violet reflections of water bubbling over rocks and floating orange-brown seaweed at an estuary in Padstow, Cornwall, “flecked with tiny fugitive crimson points.”45 Riley saw similar reflections on the Inland Sea in Japan and in the “turquoise green in the shallows of the [Mediterranean],” where atmospheric violets emerged from the green vegetation beside ocher earth.46\nRise 2 and Vapour 3 are chromatic precedents for the more recent Measure for Measure series. A series of color studies from 1970 uses the same trio of greens, oranges, and violets rendered as, instead of lines, concentric circles nestled within larger circles.47 Measure for Measure 13 (2017) marks a return to Riley’s exploration of the circle, here repeated in a grid of colored disks of gray-hued greens, violets, and oranges. In Measure for Measure 36 (2018), Riley introduces a fourth color, a turquoise green. One perceives a diagonal direction oscillating across the grid, but blink and another diagonal appears, then another, and another.48 The painting seems to vibrate. The ovals and disks that Riley likened to the Pointillist marks of Georges Seurat — as containers of visual energies, which Measure for Measure evokes in blown-up scale — also define a return to the forms of earlier paintings like Black to White Discs.49 Measure for Measure, for Riley, was a direct progression from these paintings, and she characterized the series as a solution for understanding the integral, absolute nature of the circle as a form.50\n       Expand   Bridget Riley, Measure for Measure 13, 2017.Private collection          Expand   Bridget Riley, Measure for Measure 36, 2018.Private collection     The introduction of a five-color palette, the twisted curve, and the calming effect of gray to soften the palette served as Riley’s primary visual vocabulary from 1972 until 1981 — when she began her Egyptian palette series of paintings, which explore an expansive range of colors. With Vein (1985), Riley conveys that she “organised the sequence of colours quite freely — something [she] had not done before.”51 The saturated luminescence of her palette, which she achieved with the introduction of oil, required a return to the line as a neutral vehicle. For Riley, paintings like Vein offered a new direction in her practice: “The preoccupation with methods of perception quietly shifted to the background. From [then] on I was trying to paint sensation.”52\n       Expand Bridget Riley, Vein, 1985.Collection of Albright-Knox Art Gallery, gift of Seymour H. Knox Jr., 1985  The liberated, unrestricted buoyancy of color in works like Vein led to a new stage in her practice with the introduction of multiple colors and use of black as a color (rather than as a form) in flattened rhomboidal planes — for example, in New Day (1988) and Reflection 2 (1994). Unlike the earlier works, in which the area of activity was the space between the viewer and painting, a new spatiality emerged. Riley created an interiority of space from within the picture plane by using color as an element to construct a plastic coherence within the compositions.53 This innovation is most visible in New Day and Reflection 2 and in later paintings like Rêve (1999) and Enchant (2004), in which planes of purely pigmented color advance and recede, giving viewers the impression of a space within, interrupted by intervals that hover above. Rêve and Enchant, for the artist, also signify a return to her careful study of the work of Paul Cézanne, particularly the Cubist language of planes.54\n       Expand Bridget Riley, Reflection 2, 1994.Private collection, courtesy of David Zwirner  Over the course of her career, Riley has meticulously studied the mechanics of painting, working within the relationships of form, spatiality, movement, and light. She has returned again and again to past developments in her oeuvre, refining and perfecting them, finding new relationships to exploit and new ideas to cultivate. From her initial visit to the United States — captured in her essay written specially for this publication — to the rise of her international acclaim and the present exhibition, Bridget Riley has come full circle, almost sixty years after her introduction to US audiences.\nMaryam Ohadi-Hamadani is Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and former Postdoctoral Research Associate, Yale Center for British Art. notes    Riley’s first retrospective was organized in 1970 by the Arts Council of Great Britain and shown in venues throughout the United Kingdom. The first international retrospective came to the United States, from 1978 to 1980, by way of the British Council. It opened at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and traveled to the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase, New York, and to the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts in Texas, before opening in venues in Australia and Japan. In 2001, Dia Center for the Arts in New York hosted a small survey. In 2018, there was a retrospective at the Hayward Gallery, London, and the National Galleries Scotland, Edinburgh.

The exhibition shaped Alloway’s discussion of abstraction in the catalogue for his 1966 exhibition at the Guggenheim, Systemic Painting.

She first achieved international prominence in the early 1960s with her distinctive black-and-white paintings, their rhythmic lines and curves appearing to vibrate across the canvas. Since then, Riley has relied on deceptively simple shapes to startling effect. Working in series, the artist gradually expanded her palette, introducing gray tonal variations before shifting to vivid color juxtapositions. Riley’s arresting paintings harness the disruptive and harmonious relationships among color, line, and form with compositions of remarkable complexity and vibrancy.\nSelected by the artist, the works in this exhibition comprise the largest survey of Riley’s work in the United States in twenty years. The show opens with an in-depth examination of Riley’s seminal monochrome paintings of the 1960s on the third floor and presents the full range of her oeuvre in color on the second floor. Assembling Riley’s most iconic paintings alongside rarely seen works, the exhibition traces the evolution of her deep engagement with the fundamentals of visual perception. Black and White: 1961 to 1968\nIn the early 1960s, Riley worked exclusively in black and white. The lines, curves, circles, and triangles arranged on her surfaces result in energetic patterns, which appear to shift and pulse in space. Riley first came to international attention when her black-and-white painting Current (1964) was included in The Responsive Eye, a groundbreaking exhibition of geometric abstraction at the Museum of Modern Art in 1965. The following year, Riley began to introduce tonal variations in gray, creating a completely new sensory response: perception is slowed down through the appearance of depth and spatial recession. Riley has described this use of gray as a testing ground and a bridge she had to cross to meet the challenge of color. Color: 1967 to 2022\nRiley unveiled her first color paintings in 1968 at the Venice Biennale. That year, she also became the first Briton — and the first woman — to win the prestigious international painting prize. The works on this floor trace the evolution of her use of color. Her earliest color paintings consisted of vertical stripes in a restricted palette, arranged exactingly on the canvas. Riley’s ideas about color were profoundly shaped by her experience of nature, both at home and on her travels. Riley’s visits to Australia, Egypt, and the islands of Bali, Java, Japan, and Tahiti prompted an expansion in her palette. Although the line served as Riley’s primary visual vehicle through the 1980s, she later introduced rhomboids, curvilinear planes, and other dynamic forms to evoke sensations of space, movement, and light. Through visual color relationships, Riley creates canvases that radiate energy and motion. Works by Constable and Delacroix\n“Looking carefully at paintings is the best training you can have as a young painter,” Riley has said of her deep appreciation of the work of painters of the past. For this exhibition she has selected a watercolor by Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863) and an oil study by John Constable (1776–1837) to hang alongside her work.

Using the simple form of the square, the artist achieved perceptual effects of motion and space that paved the way for her subsequent black-and-white paintings. The compression and contraction of the squares in alternating intervals of black and white cause the shapes to appear to move and recede inward, as if pulled by an unseen force.

Describing her process, Riley writes, “There are innumerable sequences, each of which throws up a different sensation. From these I build up clusters which then flow into each other almost imperceptibly.” The effect, she adds, “is of a sudden flood of bright colour.”\n","id":38,"length":118,"title":"32.

This discovery gave me a wonderful opportunity to further explore the impact that Constable’s work had upon Delacroix.\nConstable’s Sketch for “The Haywain” (fig. 1), free but controlled, depicts one of those late spring days when blustery, turbulent weather throws tall trees, heavy with new foliage, into strong tonal contrast with the sky. He called this the “chiaroscuro of nature,” and as the sky played a critical role in his view of landscape painting, he spent days “skying” — that is to say, “seeing” rather than painting. He had written twenty years earlier to a friend: “I shall not have much to show you on my return, as I find my time will be more taken up in seeing than in painting. I hope by the time the leaves are on the trees, I shall be better qualified to attack them.”1 His time spent seeing was time well spent.\n       Expand Figure 1John Constable, Sketch for “The Haywain”, ca. 1820, oil on canvas laid to paper, 47/8 x 7 in. (12.4 x 17.8 cm).Yale Center for British Art, Paul Mellon Collection, B1981.25.137  Constable argued long and forcefully for the acceptance of nature as a viable subject for the painter, claiming “there is room enough for a natural painture.”2 To John Fisher, he wrote, “The sky is the source of light in nature — and governs everything.”3 In his Sketch, clouds of the palest yellow ocher, catching the light from above, are paired with those of an intense blue gray in the shadow below. The painter employs a drawing technique of diagonal hatching to take these yellow ochers and blue grays through his sketch to build an extraordinary pictorial plasticity. He uses a brush and a palette knife — the tip or edge. The eye is led around and through the little painting — from the shadowed foreground with its lively sparkle of human activity, out through sunlit fields to the far distance, back to the trees, and up to the sky. We see the shine and glitter of a recent shower of rain, feel the wind, and hear the splash of water.\nConstable’s final painting, The Hay Wain (1821), was shown with his View on the Stour near Dedham (1822) at the 1824 Paris Salon. The response to this “six-footer” was sensational, especially the response from younger artists, who were impressed by the novelty of the work and its monumental scale. One such admirer, Eugène Delacroix, studied The Hay Wain closely, delighted by its freshness and veracity. Feeling that a new direction for the art of painting lay in the Englishman’s work, Delacroix made several visits to John Arrowsmith, a dealer holding the piece prior to its display in the Salon. In an effort to understand this new technique while finishing his own painting for the Salon, The Massacre at Chios (1824), Delacroix wrote in his journal in June 1824, “This Constable is very good for me.” He was not alone in his response to The Hay Wain. Théodore Géricault, seeing the masterpiece in London at Somerset House in 1821, was also “stunned,” he told Delacroix, and it is thought that he encouraged Arrowsmith to take it to Paris. Although critics at the time were rather annoyed by this English import, Charles X, the French king, awarded a gold medal to The Hay Wain at the 1824 Salon.\nHowever, Constable’s paintings were not well received at home. He was not accepted as a Royal Academician — receiving almost no votes in the academy’s annual elections — largely due to the adversity of England’s most powerful critic, John Ruskin (who favored J. M. W. Turner). This led Fisher to advise Constable to agree to the sale of The Hay Wain to the French — it would have been bought for the nation. But Constable, not wanting to expose his painting to hostile critics in another country, refused the offer.4 On January 22, 1825, his wife, Maria, forwarded a letter from Arrowsmith, who was partially French, telling Constable about the award of a medal from Charles X: “You see that in our country merit is rewarded, come from where it will.”5\nDelacroix’s watercolor Path on the Side of a Mountain, Eaux-Bonnes, the Pyrénées (fig. 2) is like a glass of fresh water after the heady wine of the Romantic movement. An important change takes place in his interests and practice: pictorial color becomes a passionate quest, and Delacroix discovers a stimulating difference in culture through visits to England and his friendship with the watercolor painter Richard Parkes Bonington.\n       Expand Figure 2Eugène Delacroix, Path on the Side of a Mountain, Eaux-Bonnes, the Pyrénées, 1845, watercolor over graphite, 73/8 × 121/2 in. (18.8 × 31.7 cm).Yale University Art Gallery, Everett V. Meeks, BA 1901, Fund  Delacroix approached this landscape in the same way that he approached his figure compositions: by establishing foreground, middle ground, and background. The artist is present in the point of view to the right of center. Beyond a shadowed wall lies the diagonal passage of the hillside, leading to a screen of dark vegetation and little trees. Seen in opposite light, these appear in soft washes of blue greens, dark greens, olive greens, yellow greens, light greens, bright greens, gray greens, and even turquoise. The distant mountains recede through blue violets to the opalescent tints and fugitive greens of the sky above — an instance, perhaps, of what Delacroix would later call the “concatenation of colour,” a link or chain of color relationships.\nAround this time, Constable notes in his papers: “In such an age as this, painting should be understood, not looked on with blind wonder, nor considered only as a poetic aspiration, but as a pursuit, legitimate, scientific, and mechanical.”6 Although Constable and Delacroix never met, communication took place in the athletics of perception. In September 1846, one year after Path on the Side of a Mountain, Delacroix assesses his encounter with The Hay Wain in his journal: “Constable says that the green of his meadows is superior to that of other artists because it is composed of a multitude of different greens. The lack of intensity and life in the verdure of the common run of landscape painters is due to the fact that it is usually painted in uniform colour. What he says here of the green of the meadows can be applied to all the other colours.” The last entry in Delacroix’s journal reads, “It is the first merit of a painting to be a feast for the eyes.”7\nOn July 25, 1836, in his last lecture at the Literary and Scientific Institution in Hampstead, Constable included his statement that “the art of seeing nature is a thing almost as much to be acquired as the art of reading the Egyptian hieroglyphics.”8 Delacroix’s little watercolor may be an early sign of his great undertaking to penetrate the nature of pictorial color and discover its principles. He also established procedures that would prove to be of immense value not only to the Impressionists and Postimpressionists but also to succeeding generations of aspiring colorists — including myself. notes    Quoted in Charles R.
